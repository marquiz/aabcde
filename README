AABCDE - An Audio Book CD Extractor
===================================

This is a very simple helper script for converting audio book CDs into m4b
audiobook format. Usage is simple enough, just run the script:
 $ aabcde
and it will extract the CDs and eventually copy the output files to
$HOME/Audiobooks.

The script saves its state so that it can continue in case the extraction is
interrupted (extracting a 20 disc audio book takes some time). When re-run in
the same directory after an interrupted the script will continue from where it
was.

REQUIREMENTS:
- python
- cdparanoia
- faac
- gpac (for MP4Box)
- mp4v2-utils (for mp4tags)
